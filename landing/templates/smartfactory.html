                <p>The topical keywords of IoT (Internet of Things) and Industry 4.0 are new concepts that will
                    guide manufacturing to the future.JMAC are currently providing consulting to our clients in the
                    following three fields:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Smart Factory Grand Design Creation Consulting</li>
                    <li>Smart Analytics Consulting</li>
                    <li>Business Model Structure Creation Consulting Using IoT/ICT</li>
                </ol>

                    <h2><li><b>Smart Factory Grand Design Creation Consulting</b></li></h2><hr/>
                    <p>We are supporting the grand design of smart factories that further emphasizes our clients'
                        strength in monodzukuri. Smart factories consist of five layers. An approach with this
                        understanding of these layers is necessary.</p><br/>

                    </center>
                    <p>In layers four and five, individual pieces of information are connected in real time, and
                        dramatically increase the speed of kaizen. But smart factories cannot be achieved through
                        only focusing on these layers. It is necessary to understand how to establish and integrate
                        the various functions utilizing the specific strengths of your organization in production
                        systems (process allocation, production planning, automation), information, management,
                        and more.</p>
                    <p>In addition, it is necessary to increase both the level of IT, ICT and IoT usage and level
                        of operations. With minimal IT, ICT and IoT investment, it is possible to implement a smart
                        factory that is appropriate for the specific competitive needs of your company.</p>

                        <p>The Genba IoT Seven Tools are used to connect various items on the shop floor to the
                            internet, simultaneously visualize the shop floor status and conduct analysis. They are
                            particularly useful in transfering into data the status of older equipment that does not
                            have communication capability, or the work of people that can be difficult to capture
