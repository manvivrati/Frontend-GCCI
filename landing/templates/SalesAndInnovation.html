                <h2><b>Sales Force Enhancement</b></h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>Sales force enhancement is said to be a key issue in determining a corporate’s competitiveness.
                    However, this area is also said to be one of the most difficult area for any improvement.
                    To ensure an improvement with actual output, it is necessary to optimize “Strategy”
                    “ Management” & “Skill” in sales department. JMAC works together with company sales personnel
                    in the front line & provides appropriate solution to realize the optimization
                    of the abovementioned aspects.</p>
                <h2><b>Service & Operation Enhancement</b></h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>Service differs from physical objects in character such as intangible (has no shapes),
                    synchronism (production and consumption happen simultaneously), and inhomogeneity
                    (depens on people, and unevenness happens easily). But, it has been managed by approaches
                    used to manage quality of physical objects. As a result, quality control for service & service
                    oriented operation is an issue.</p>
                <p>In JMAC, we have expertise in quality enhancement specific
                    to the characteristics of service and operation through our many years of experience in CS
                    enhancement support to our clients.</p>
                <p>Utilizing this expertise, JMAC provides unique
                    solution to enhance overall service & operation quality covering from planning, designing
                    to implementation, refine & review.</p>
                <h2><b>Call Center Innovation</b></h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>Call center carries high expectation as direct contact point with valuable customers.
                    However, if we look at the result, CS & response quality are not improving & cost reduction
                    is also hard to materialize. Furthermore, as contrary to the high expectation as front line to
                    collect voices from customers, call centers are having problem with high turnover rate & staff
                    development, as they are exhausted by dairy operation, it is very difficult to eliminate the
                    gap between expectation to contribute to business & actual operation.<br/>
                    From the viewpoints of CS enhancement, cost reduction & contribution to other departments,
                    JMAC provides appropriate solutions in each phase from set up/consolidation to stable operation
                    & further improvement to realize a more strategic call center</p>
                <h2><b>Dealer Process Improvement</b></h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>Many companies are not aware of the importance of after-sales services. Actually, the service
                    profitability gap is higher between stores than for the sales division and the service
                    profitability significantly contributes to repurchase probability.</p>
                <p>At worksites, employees are working overtime and doing their best, but this is not reflected
                    in the results.</p>
                <p>JMAC’s Dealer Process Improvement (DPI) will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improve business processes (how work is carried out);</li>
                    <li>Integrate the large amount of information that is distributed across worksites or among staff;</li>
                    <li>Promote the standardization and sharing of best practices;</li>
                    <li>Enhance employee capabilities and customer service attitudes; and</li>
                    <li>Promote the diffusion of skills necessary for enhancing customer satisfaction accross the business organization</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Companies will be able to achieve the following by implementing the JMAC dealer reform program (DPI):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Changes to the service quality offered to customers (enhanced customer services)</li>
                    <li>Change to a more profitable business structure (enhanced sales/profits)</li>
                    <li>Change in motivation of employees (enhanced ES)</li>
                </ol>
